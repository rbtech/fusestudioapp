		@scriptmodule FuseJS/InterApp

		The InterApp API allows you to launch other apps, as well as respond to being launched via URI schemes.

		This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

		You need to add a reference to `"Fuse.Launcher"` in your project file to use this feature.

		## Example

			var InterApp = require("FuseJS/InterApp");

			InterApp.on("receivedUri", function(uri) {
				console.log("Launched with URI", uri);
			});

			InterApp.launchUri("https://fuseopen.com/");

		In the above example we're using the @EventEmitter `on` method to listen to the `"receivedUri"` event.

		For the [receivedUri](api:fuse/reactive/fusejs/interapp/onreceiveduri_968f99a6.json) event to be triggered, you need register a custom URI scheme for your app, as shown [here](articles:basics/uno-projects#mobile-urischeme).

			@param uri (String) The URI to launch.

			Requests the system to launch an app that handles the specified URI.

			Note: you can pass any URI string to `launchUri`, but how it is handled will depend on the target platform and particular device settings.

			There are several common URI schemes that you can use on both Android and iOS:
				http://<website address>
				https://<website address>
				tel:<phone number>
				sms:<phone number>

			Other platform-specific URI schemes are known to be working fine, for example `geo:<parameters>` launches Maps application on Android
			and `facetime:<parameters>` launches a Facetime video call on iOS.
			More information on supported URI schemes: [on Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html) and [on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html).
